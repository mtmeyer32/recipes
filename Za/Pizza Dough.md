4 cups flour (more as needed)
1.5 cups water (more as needed)
2 tbsp molasses (honey or combination)
2 tsp salt
1 tbsp olive oil
2 packets yeast

Heat water to 140 degrees.

Mix flour and salt briefly with bread hook.

Add molasses and yeast to warm water stir to dissolve, wait 10 mins for yeast to activate. If using instant yeast, dont need to wait.

Once liquids have been incorperated dough will likely be too dry, add more warm water slowly targetting dry spots in bowl until all ingredients are fully mixed.

You want to get dough to a point that it is too wet and then slowly add back more flour until it is sticky but not wet.

Prepare counter and hands with coat of flour remove dough from bowl and kneed in flour until dough is not longer sticky.

Coat bowl with dash of olive oil, place dough ball in bowl and cover with towel. Allow to rise until the dough has 2-3x in size or you are too hungry to wait any longer.
